## Highlight

A UI-based Data Science and Machine Learning toolkit that acts as a ready UI to perform all the major Data-science and Machine Learning operations, like, viewing the dataset statistics, and its information, performing EDA, data modification and cleaning operations, and visualization using different charts (say, line, bar, scatter, heatmap, box, etc.), model training, tuning, validation, evaluation, prediction, etc. 

The idea behind this project was to accompany an industry client (say a user who may not know programming or details of ML implementation using a coding language) to perform a Supervised ML process in a fast, supported, and easy manner. The user of this toolkit can perform all the operations (right from browsing & importing the dataset to making predictions on the test set) just by clicking the buttons on the toolkit UI. In short, the user can perform all the main required operations of an ML model-building process, without having much programming knowledge (because all they will have to do is click on the buttons in that interactive UI). 

The toolkit will help the clients to perform Machine Learning operations (without needing them to have any programming knowledge). Also, the users of this toolkit will be able to build and compare various models in less time.
